Hello! My name is Maria, and today I'm greeting you from Buenos Aires. It's Saturday, and we're going to explore the city and i`ll try to tell you a little bit about myself.

Initially, I studied medicine and worked in healthcare. I've always loved helping people and making a difference in their lives. But as much as I enjoyed medicine, I found myself really interested in programming for a few reasons.

Firstly, I was intrigued by the problem-solving nature of programming. Medicine and programming may seem like two totally different fields, but they share a common thread - the need to analyze complex problems. I get to tackle all kinds of challenges and come up with elegant solutions. 

Secondly, I discovered that programming offered a mix of creativity and logical thinking. It lets me flex my brain muscles, think outside the box, and keep on learning and expanding my skills. It's like a never-ending adventure!

The world of programming is constantly evolving, and that's what keeps me hooked. There's always something new to learn, a new language or framework to explore. It pushes me to stay on my toes, grow my skills, and stay up-to-date with the latest trends.

For a few months before RS School, I had been learning on my own and working on pet projects. But I've always had a soft spot for a good challenge, and RS School seemed like just the thing. So, I made the decision to enroll. So for the past 3 months, I've been traveling around South America and attending RS School. It hasn't always been easy, but let me tell you, it has been completely worth it. I learned a lot, not only about programming but also about the importance of pushing beyond my comfort zone. Thatâ€™s all for now, I hope you enjoyed the video, thanks for watching!
